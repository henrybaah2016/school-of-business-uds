							<h2>PhD Business Administration (Finance)</h2>
							<p>
                                Finance academics at UDS School of Business research on various financial issues, including asset pricing and valuation, market behaviour, capital structure, mergers and acquisitions, and financial inclusion. Research in these areas is pursued through the development of theoretical models and empirical testing of those models. The PhD Programme is designed to give students a good understanding of the methods used in theoretical modelling and empirical testing.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Preparation and Qualifications</h3>
                            <p>
                                
Students are expected to have familiarity with programming and data analysis using tools and software such as Eviews, MATLAB, Stata, R, Python or to correct any deficiencies before enrolling. There is keen competition for admission into the PhD Finance programme , which involves a great deal of hard work. For both these reasons, the faculty is selective in offering admission. Prospective applicants must have an aptitude for quantitative work and be at ease in handling formal models. A strong background in economics, statistics and mathematics is desirable.
